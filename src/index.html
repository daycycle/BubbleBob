                            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

                            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
                        
                        <p>10. Additional Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability. This
                            section is meant as an addition to Sections 8 and 9, nothing in this
                            section shall limit the effects of Sections 8 and 9 or any other
                            provision in the other Sections of this License.
                            This Software should only be used as a simulation tool and not for real
                            dives. There is no warranty that anything displayed by the Software is
                            good information. Use of this Software for other purposes may result in
                            serious injuries or death.
                            This Software was not made by medical doctors. Nothing displayed by the
                            Software constitutes medical advice.
                            The Software does not replace proper relevant training. You must be
                            trained and certified to dive. You must dive within the limits of your
                            certification.
                            The Software does not encourage you to dive within the depth ranges it
                            may display as acceptable. Nor does it encourage you to use or not use
                            any specific gas mix. You must have proper training to choose and use a
                            gas mix.</p>
                        
                        <p>11. In the event that a Section or part of a Section is invalidated by a
                            court, the remaining parts of this License shall fully apply.</p>
